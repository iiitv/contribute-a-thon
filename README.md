### Criteria for Contributions ü§ì
- Contributions will be counted only after the event has started i.e from 01 October :new_moon_with_face:
- To communicate with the maintainers use `@iiitv/project-maintainers` in the comments section on repos.
- For communicating with everyone else use the __[discord channel](https://discord.gg/pUPbVHF)__  and join the `#contribute-a-thon-discussions` to interact with project maintainers.
- Only issues having **contribute-a-thon** label & **up-for-grabs** on them will be available for contribution.
- Participants can create issues if there is need like fixing a bug :bug:, writing tests, updating documentation etc, the `@iiitv/project-maintainers` will review the issue and add the labels as stated above then it will be counted as a contribution.
- Participants need to fork the repo before making any contributions.
- The pull request (PR) title should specify the purpose for the PR.
- Only merged PRs will be counted as a contribution.
- Since difficulty level of every PR will not be same for everybody so there are __3__ levels in PR __easy__, __medium__ & __hard__.
- __(Important)__ Make a google doc with your GitHub username as the doc's name, in this üëâ __[folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B5obEZWVrWWoN4YQftcEUAsTv5pz1hxA?usp=sharing)__ to keep a track of your daily contributions. 
- We have further subdivided our project maintainers into their respective tech stacks :
  - `@iiitv/algo-maintainers`
  - `@iiitv/django-maintainers`
  - `@iiitv/nodejs-maintainers`
  - `@iiitv/react-maintainers`
  - `@iiitv/flutter-maintainers`

- If you want to work on any issue just tag the `@iiitv/<tech stack of that respective repository>-maintainers` or `@iiitv/project-maintainers` stating that "I want to work on this issue", the maintainers will assign the respective issue to you.
